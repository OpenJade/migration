        RELEASE 2.6
	* jadetex.dtx: removed \@begindocumenthook from \FOT. fouls up

	* RELEASE 2.3 (maybe test only)
	* jadetex.dtx: more vertical space changes. call \the\everypar at
	end of Displaynic and start of endDisplayNIC. Desparation. forget
	flags. forget conditional calls to useJadevskip. scream.

	* jadetex.dtx: an infinity of changes to get vertical space right
	with much help from David Carlisle.
	The algorithm now is
	a) at start of DisplayGroup:
	   1. if flag set, use Jadeskip
	   2. set Jadeskip to computed above-space; set flag
        b) at end of DisplayGroup, set Jadeskip to 
	          computed below-space; set flag
	c) at \everypar, use Jadeskip
	d) at use Jadeskip, unset flag

this means that the Jadeskip space is replaced each time, and normally
activated by everypar, but it is also activated by hand when a new
display object starts; this makes \par\par\par have the right behaviour

Sun Oct 04 22:32:35 1998  Sebastian Rahtz  <s.rahtz@elsevier.co.uk>
