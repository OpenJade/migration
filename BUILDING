Build Instructions
==================

   These are generic build instructions.

   OpenSP and OpenJade now use the GNU configuration tools autoconf,
automake, and libtool for compilation.  To create a configure script
you will need to run './autogen.sh'. Alternatively, you can run the
following commands in order:

/cvs/sp$ aclocal
/cvs/sp$ autoheader
/cvs/sp$ automake --add-missing
/cvs/sp$ autoconf

   The 'autogen.sh' script or the above commands should create a
useable 'configure' shell script that you can use to compile the
application.

/cvs/sp$ ./configure
/cvs/sp$ make
/cvs/sp$ make install
