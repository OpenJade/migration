>Basically it works like a copying collector, but the copying is
	logical rather than physical.  There are two doubly-linked lists one
	for each of the two spaces of a copying collector.  Every object is
	one of these two lists.  There's also a bit (the "color") which says
	which space it is in. To "copy" an object from one space to another,
	it is unlinked from one list, linked into the other, and its color is
	flipped.  A key point is that unlike normal copying collectors, this
	collector never changes the address of a GC object.
      </P
><P
>This is a simplification. It is optimized so that there is one big 
	circular list of all objects. A pointer into the list separates the 
	allocated from the free list.  Allocating just moves the pointer along 
	the list.
      </P
><P
>Garbage collection starts with a set of root objects (more on this 
	later). It finds all objects reachable from this set of root objects. 
	All objects not reachable are considered garbage and are put on the
	free list where they can be reused.  If garbage collection doesn't
	free up enough objects, then more memory is allocated from the system.

>It supports finalization (the ability to call an GC object's
	  destructor when the object is GCed).  All finalizable objects occur
	  before non-finalizable objects in the allocated list.  The garbage
	  collection arranges so that immediately after completing the copy
	  part of a garbage collection, the objects needing finalization are
	  at the head of the free list, thus allowing the collector to
	  efficiently perform finalization.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Objects which are created during the parsing of the
	  stylesheet, which can never become garbage during the processing of
	  the source document, are separated off into a separate area (these
	  are called "permanent").  All objects reachable from a permanent
	  object must themselves be permanent.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>It has the concept of an object being read-only: it can mark
	  an object and all objects reachable from that object as being
	  read-only (needed for Jade extensions which allow limited mutation

>It always allocates a fixed amount of space for a GC object;
	  so the <B
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>sizeof()</B
> any object derived from
	  ELObj must be &#8804; this space. How big 
	  is it? On a 32-bit machine there is space for 16 bytes (eg 4
	  pointers, or a double+int+pointer) beyond what is used by the
	  ELObj itself.  On a 64-bit machine it will be
	  about twice that; <B

	  ELObj to the table in
	  <B
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>maxObjSize()</B
>.  But make 
	  sure you don't use more than 16 bytes on a 32-bit machine, otherwise
	  you will significantly increase Jade's memory consumption.  If you
	  need more space than this, then the ELObj
	  should have a pointer to dynamcally alloacted memory; in this case
	  you must deallocate the memory in the destructor.  In this case and
	  any other case where an ELObj has a  
	  destructor that must be called, you must declare an operator

This tells the garbage collector that the object has a destructor that
must be called when the object becomes garbage.</P

><P
>A key aspect of correct use of the garbage collector is to ensure
	that the collector always has a sufficient set of roots.  Any time
	that C++ code does anything that may allocate a GC object, any GC
	object that is not reachable from a root object may get recycled by
	the system.  The way to create a root is to use an auto variable of
	type ELObjDynamicRoot.  An
	ELObjDynamicRoot adds a single
	ELObj as a root for the
	Collector for as long as the
	ELObjDynamicRoot is in scope.  The first
	argument of the ELObjDynamicRoot constructor
	specifies the collector. The second argument specifies the
	ELObj that is to be made a root. The
	ELObj that the
	ELObjDynamicRoot causes to be a 
	root can be changed by assiging an ELObj to the
	ELObjDynamicRoot.  There's also a  
	conversion from ELObjDynamicRoot to
	ELObj *.</P
