openjade (1.3.4-19991003-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * new package; note that this package doesn't divert existing jade or SP
    stuff, although it *could* (closes: Bug#41697)
  * OpenJade varies from Jade in some small but noticable ways; to wit, it
    includes Jade internals documentation, several changes for increased
    ISO standards compliance, a new program 'spcat' for interacting with
    the catalog manager, ability to bind values with arbitrary values on
    the command line, and other changes.  Programs vary from the sp/jade
    versions in that they begin with the letter 'o' (osx remains osx, not
    osgml2xml as in sp)
