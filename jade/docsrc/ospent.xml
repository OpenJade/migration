SYNOPSIS

   spent [ -Cnrv ] [ -bbctf ] [ -Ddirectory ] sysid...
   
DESCRIPTION

   Spent (SGML print entity) prints the concatenation of the entities
   with [1]system identifiers sysid... on the standard output.
   
   The following options are available:
   
   -bbctf
          Use the [2]BCTF with name bctf for output.
          
   -C
          This has the same effect as in [3]nsgmls.
          
   -Ddirectory
          Search directory for files specified in system identifiers.
          This has the same effect as in [4]nsgmls.
          
   -n
          The entity is a non-SGML data entity. This option forces the
          octets in the storage objects comprising the entity to be
          copied exactly without any of the conversions that are done for
          text entities. Implies -r.
          
   -r
          Raw output. Don't perform any conversion on RSs and REs when
          printing the entity. The entity would typically have the
          storage manager attribute records=asis.
          
   -v
          Print the version number.
