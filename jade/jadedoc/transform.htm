<h1>Using Jade for SGML transformations</h1>
<P>
Jade does not support the DSSSL Transformation Language.  However, it
provides some simple, non-standardized extensions to the DSSSL Style
Language that allow it to be used for SGML transformations.
<P>
These extensions are used in conjunction with the SGML backend which
is selected with the <SAMP>-t sgml</SAMP> option.
Unlike other backends,
the SGML backend writes its output to the standard output.
<P>
The extensions consist of a collection of flow object classes that are used
instead of the standard DSSSL-defined flow object classes:
<DL>
<DT>
<CODE>element</CODE>
<DT>
<CODE>empty-element</CODE>
<DD>
Each of these flow objects results in an element in the output.  The
<CODE>element</CODE> flow object is a compound flow object (one that
can have child flow objects).  Both a start-tag and an end-tag are
generated for this flow object.  The <CODE>empty-element</CODE> is an
atomic flow object (one that cannot have child flow objects).  Only a
start-tag is output for this.  It should should be used for elements
with a declared content of EMPTY or with a content reference
attribute.
Both of these flow objects support the following non-inherited
characteristics:
<DL>
<DT>
<CODE>gi</CODE>
<DD>
This is a string-valued characteristic that specifies the element's
generic identifier.
It defaults to the generic identifier of the current node.
<DT>
<CODE>attribute</CODE>
<DD>
This specifies the element's attributes as a list of lists each of
which consists of exactly two strings, the first specifying the
attribute name and the second the attribute value.
It defaults to the empty list.
</DL>
<DD>
<DT>
<CODE>processing-instruction</CODE>
<DD>
This is an atomic flow object that results in a processing instruction.
It supports the following non-inherited characteristics:
<DL>
<DT>
<CODE>data</CODE>
<DD>
This is a string-valued characteristic that specifies the content
of the processing instruction.
It defaults to the empty string.
</DL>
<DT>
<CODE>document-type</CODE>
<DD>
This is an atomic flow object that results in a DOCTYPE declaration.
It supports the following non-inherited characteristics:
<DL>
<DT>
<CODE>name</CODE>
<DD>
This is a string-valued characteristic that specifies the name
of the document type (which must be the same as the name of
the document element).
It must not be omitted.
<DT>
<CODE>system-id</CODE>
<DD>
This is a string-valued characteristic that specifies the system identifier
of the document type.
If non-empty, this will be used as the system identifier in the
doctype declaration.
The default value is the empty string.
<DT>
<CODE>public-id</CODE>
<DD>
This is a string-valued characteristic that specifies the public identifier
of the document type.
If non-empty, this will be used as the public identifier in the
doctype declaration.
The default value is the empty string.
</DL>
</DL>
<P>
Each of these flow object classes must be declared using
<CODE>declare-flow-object-class</CODE> in any DSSSL specification that
makes use of it.
A suitable set of declarations is:
<PRE>
(declare-flow-object-class element
  "UNREGISTERED::James Clark//Flow Object Class::element")
(declare-flow-object-class empty-element
  "UNREGISTERED::James Clark//Flow Object Class::empty-element")
(declare-flow-object-class document-type
  "UNREGISTERED::James Clark//Flow Object Class::document-type")
(declare-flow-object-class processing-instruction
  "UNREGISTERED::James Clark//Flow Object Class::processing-instruction")
</PRE>
<P>
Here's a simple example that does the identity transformation:
<PRE>
&lt;!doctype style-sheet PUBLIC "-//James Clark//DTD DSSSL Style Sheet//EN">

(declare-flow-object-class element
  "UNREGISTERED::James Clark//Flow Object Class::element")

(define (copy-attributes #!optional (nd (current-node)))
  (let loop ((atts (named-node-list-names (attributes nd))))
    (if (null? atts)
        '()
        (let* ((name (car atts))
               (value (attribute-string name nd)))
          (if value
              (cons (list name value)
                    (loop (cdr atts)))
              (loop (cdr atts)))))))

(default (make element
               attributes: (copy-attributes)))
</PRE>
<P>
Note that this does not deal with empty elements nor processing
instructions, nor does it include a doctype declaration.
