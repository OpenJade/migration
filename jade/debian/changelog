openjade (1.4devel1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: fix override disparities in libostyle0 and
    libostyle-dev
  * debian/control: build-depends on gettext
    closes: #105181
  * problem fixed a while ago where we weren't shipping the HTML
    documentation
    closes: #71093
  * Japanese translation added upstream
  * debian/rules: make maintainer-clean upstream is incredibly fragile,
    so tolerate errors there until that gets fixed
  * debian/rules: during build, run libtoolize --force to replace this
    libtoolize stuff, which is needed for arches which diverge from the
    libtool stuff OpenSP ships with
  * debian/rules, control: use dh_shlibdeps, remove some hand-rolled stuff
    here which was unnecessary and in fact adding two libosp deps on the
    opensp package, not to mention that it stopped working

openjade (1.4devel1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * upstream changes from CVS, see NEWS
  * debian/rules: compile with -O3 instead of -O2 to try to get this thing
    faster; CXXFLAGS propogates to the library stuff properly now; remove
    an extra licensing file (thanks, lintian); some improvements in clean
    and cvs-build (snapshot building); run aclocal and autoheader, I think
    this is proper -- it certainly inhibits some warnings
  * debian/control: update standards to 3.5.0 (no changes required)
