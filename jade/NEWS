Changes in OpenJade 1.4

* The "media" and "title" attributes in stylesheet PIs are supported.

* A new external procedure with public identifier
  "UNREGISTERED::OpenJade//Procedure::uri-ref-address" returns an address
  object to the supplied URI. This allows hyperlinks to resources of the WWW
  in documents. Currently URI references are implemented in the HTML/CSS back
  end.

* The command line option --help gives a summary of the usage and all
  supported command line options.

* Separate cmdline options for the two SGML parsers used for the document and
  the style-sheet.

* GNU-style long command line options are now supported in addition to the
  short ones.

* OpenJade is internationalized. Translations for many messages are available
  in German and Swedish.

* The standard flow objects check that their content is valid.

* Internal defines (ie defines at the begin of a body) are supported. 
  
* The char-map inherited characteristic is supported. 

* (test => recipient) cond clauses are supported.

Changes in OpenJade 1.3

* The SGML backend will no emit linebreaks when used as -t sgml-raw.

* OpenJade can bind variables to arbitrary values on the command line. 

* The prlabs1 module of the SGML property set is supported.

* Style sheet extensions.dsl lists all known
  external procedures ready for easy inclusion
  as an external-specification.

* External procedure with public identifier
  "UNREGISTERED::OpenJade//Procedure::expt"
  allows to form integral powers of quantities.
  
* External procedure with public identifier
  "UNREGISTERED::OpenJade//Procedure::sgml-parse"
  allows to parse wrt. an architecture.

* OpenJade supports force! for inherited characteristics.

* OpenJade supports character properties.
 
* OpenJade supports special-query-expressions.

* OpenJade can bind variables to string values on the command line.

* All standard color spaces supported. 

* OpenJade ignores duplicate keywords in make expressions, as 
  mandated by DSSSL.

* External procedure with public identifier
  "UNREGISTERED::OpenJade//Procedure::language"
  to create a language object by reference to a POSIX locale.
 
* Language-dependent procedures of the expression language:
  language?, current-language, declare-default-language, 
  with-language, define-language, char<?, char>?, char<=?,
  char>=?, char-ci=?, char-ci<?, char-ci>?, char-ci<=?,
  char-ci>=?, char-upcase, char-downcase, string-ci=?,
  string-equiv?, string<?, string>?, string<=?, string>=?,
  string-ci<?, string-ci>?, string-ci<=?, string-ci>=?.

* The style-sheet.dtd derived from the dsssl architecture
  has been extended (in a backwards compatible way) to
  include the delaration element type forms supported by
  Jade. The public identifier for the dtd is 

  "-//OpenJade//DTD DSSSL Style Sheet//EN" 
  
* char-repertoire, add-name-chars and add-separator-chars
  declaration element type forms are supported. When given
  the -s cmdline flag, Jade doesn't use its builtin 
  character repertoire.
  
* Most of the derived procedures in the query language:
  current-root, node-list-reduce, node-list-contains?,
  node-list-remove-duplicates, node-list-union, 
  node-list-intersection, node-list-difference, 
  node-list-symmetric-difference, node-list-union-map,
  node-list-some?, node-list-every?, node-list-filter,
  node-list->list, node-list-tail, node-list-head,
  node-list-sublist, node-list-count, node-list-last,
  node-list-property, origin, origin-to-subnode-rel,
  tree-root, grove-root, source, subtree, subgrove,
  ancestors, grove-root-path, rsiblings, ipreced,
  ifollow, grove-before?, sort-in-tree-order, tree-before?,
  tree-before, property-lookup, select-by-property, 
  select-by-null-property, select-by-missing-property,
  attribute, referent, q-element, q-class, q-sdata.

  type forms are supported.

* Style language additions: map-constructor.
 
* + and - return a length-spec if any of there arguments
  is a length-spec.

  c...r, assoc, keyword->string, string->keyword, exact?, inexact?,
  zero?, positive?, negative?, odd?, even?, exp, log, sin, cos,
  tan, asin, acos, atan, expt, exact->inexact, inexact->exact,
