Build Instructions
==================

   These are generic build instructions.

   OpenSP and OpenJade now use the GNU configuration tools autoconf,
automake, and libtool for compilation.  To create a configure script
you will need to run the following commands in order:

/cvs/sp$ aclocal
/cvs/sp$ autoheader
/cvs/sp$ automake --add-missing
/cvs/sp$ autoconf

   This should create a useable 'configure' shell script that you can
use to compile the application.

/cvs/sp$ ./configure
/cvs/sp$ make
/cvs/sp$ make install


Known Issues
============

* If `aclocal` complains of a missing 'AM_GNU_GETTEXT' macro, you're
  probably missing the gettext devel bits (the 'gettext-devel' RPM,
  or the 'gettext.m4' macro definition file, depending on your system).
