openjade (1.4devel1-3.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * EXPERIMENTAL
  * upstream changes from CVS, see NEWS
  * debian/rules: compile with -O3 instead of -O2 to try to get this thing
    faster; CXXFLAGS propogates to the library stuff properly now; remove
    an extra licensing file (thanks, lintian); some improvements in clean
    and cvs-build (snapshot building); run aclocal and autoheader, I think
    this is proper -- it certainly inhibits some warnings
  * debian/control: update standards to 3.5.0 (no changes required)
