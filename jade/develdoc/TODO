* Allow different options for spec parser and doc parser ?
  Idea: change semantics of cmdline so that parser options
  before the -d flag apply only to the spec parser, options
  after it only to the doc parser.

Things which are missing and need a lot of work
===============================================

* query: leads to current-node not being an element node.

* char-script-case: this should be handled by the backends.

* baseset-encoding, literal-described-char, other-chars: 
  must abandon SP_CHARSET_FIXED to do this, since otherwise
  SP does unwanted conversions on numeric char refs. On the
  other hand, we do want SP_CHARSET_FIXED, if we are using
  jades builtin repertoire (ie Unicode). Since Char is only
  16bit, have to map other-chars in the private area somewhere
  and tell the user/backend about it.
  
* combine-char: If we do this, we can't do character translation
  as a map char --> char any longer, but instead have to deal
  with string --> string.

* Annex K #ALL/#IMLICIT content tokens. Implementation idea: At the 
  begin of the instance and after seeing a new implicit element type 
  in the instance, go over all definitions and recompile the model 
  groups. Also adjust the inclusions/exclusions. Optimization: recompile 
  only those which actually use #ALL/#IMPLICIT.

* Annex K DTD data entities: add a DTD notation framework. Applications
  should have a way to register DTD notation handlers which would then
  be called for DTD data entities with the corresponding notation. They
  would get a pointer to the entity and to the current Dtd and would
  add the element and entity declarations they extract from the entity
  to the Dtd.

* check table-auto-width and multi-process features.


Simple things
=============

* Concur: Forbit name groups in parameter entity references in 
  document type specifications in tags.

* install ports, ICs, etc only in SL Interpreters.

* Perhaps split InterpreterMessages into InterpreterMessages and 
  SchemeParserMessages (and more...). 

* Set up framework for I18N: generating .po from .msg, po/OpenXYZ.pot from ../*.po,
  generate and install .mo files. See GNU gettext Makefile.in.in.



Things which have to be added to the jade internals documentation
=================================================================

*  writing backends.

*  scheme primitives: special meaning of partIndex == unsigned(-1),
   (define internal: ...), (define feature: foo ...).

*  language stuff.

*  feature checking.

*  grove plan checking.

*  color spaces.

*  char repertoire stuff.

* messages: module stuff, message numbers 

Reorganization
==============

* move the generated config.h files to toplevel.

* clean up the mess of SP_ defines:
 
  replace many SP_ defines by their more `standard' automake
  names (see the bottom of acconfig.h)

  replace SP_ANSI_LIB by HAVE_NEW / HAVE_CASSERT
